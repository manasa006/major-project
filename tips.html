<p>Personal loan eligibility is determined by lenders based on various factors. Every lender has certain eligibility criteria that borrowers must meet to become eligible for a personal loan. You can check your personal loan eligibility by visiting the lender’s site. After providing the required details, the lender’s verification team determines your eligibility.
    It is important for borrowers to check their personal loan eligibility to get their loan application approved without any hassle. A personal loan eligibility check helps borrowers avoid unnecessary hard inquiries.

<h5>Steps to improve loan eligibility predict</h5>
<p><ul type="square">
<li>Lower Rate of Interest: Borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria stand a chance of getting a personal loan at a lower rate of interest.</li>
<li>Higher Loan Amount: If the lender feels that the borrower meets the set eligibility criteria, chances are that a higher loan amount might be sanctioned..</li>
<li>Fast Approval and Disbursal: Borrowers with a strong credit history get their personal loan approved and disbursed faster.</li>
<li>Employer Reputation: Further, among salaried individuals, those employed with MNCs or government jobs are given higher preference compared to those with jobs in start-ups or non-listed companies.</li>
<li>Credit Score: Borrowers with a credit score of 750 and above are considered creditworthy. Banks and NBFCs generally prefer to offer personal loans to such applicants. Borrowers with lower credit scores may be charged high rates of interest.</li>
<li>Employment Type: Among salaried and self-employed applicants, lenders prefer applicants with higher monthly salaries or self-employed individuals with a high turnover in business.</li>
<li>Age: Lenders favor loan applicants over 25 because they anticipate that they will have secure employment as opposed to older borrowers who are close to retirement or superannuation.</li>
<li>When you need emergency funds, you may apply to multiple loan providers to increase your chances of approval. But you must consider the fact that each application results in a hard inquiry on your credit report, which eventually reduces your credit rating and lowers your chances of approval.</li>
<li>24/7 customer support.</li>
<li>Each and every pewdiction is simple, safe and secure.</li>
